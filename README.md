# Family Tree

A web application built with ReactJS and Vite, which displays a family tree of your direct ancestors based on data stored in a Google Spreadsheet document.

## How to use this web app

You'll need the following:
- A Google Sheets document, which will contain the data for your family tree
- A copy of this repository, cloned to your local hard drive and accessible in your terminal
- Your own `.env` configuration file, placed in the root of the repository directory, which will point the web app to your Google Sheets document

## Part 1: Google Sheets document

In the project directory, you can run: `yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
